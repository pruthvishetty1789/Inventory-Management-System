#  📦 Inventory Management System 

This is a full-stack Inventory Management System web application that I designed and developed from scratch using the **MERN stack**—MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. It allows users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on inventory products.
